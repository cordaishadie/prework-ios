## App Brainstorming

### Favorite Apps and Features
1. Instagram – Clean layout, intuitive interactions
2. Notion – Flexible and customizable UI

### App Idea: MarchEd
MarchEd is a personalized AI-powered education app designed to help students create smart, adaptive learning paths based on their goals, pace, and learning style. Features may include progress tracking, personalized daily tasks, motivational check-ins, and visual dashboards. I plan to develop this app into a full educational platform by the end of 2025.
